# The Admin Employees DashBoard

> This is Admin Employees DashBoard that I used while working in Vietnam by Excel.

I would like to recap what I studied about `MySQL`.
<br>
So, I want to use `every query manipulation sentences` that I studied before.
<br>
Because I somedays, somehow may use MySQL for my projects.

### 1. Show My Employees

- I implemented this chart from MUI Charts module installed by npm.
- You can see your employees' data like above.
- I used to maintain local staffs' data in Excel while working in Vietnam.

- You can edit your employees' data like above.
- For this CRUD, I tried to use as many query manipulation sentences as possible I can.
- I can understand how MySQL Systems works in Backend while proceeding this project.
